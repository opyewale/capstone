					Our Current technology allows us to do motion capture of a single person within a camera view using both IMU's, which are attached to the person at their elbows, knees and back, needing a total of 5 IMU's currently. We have been able to achieve 95% accuracy of joint dynamic tracking for high speeds, and 98% accuracy for low speeds. This allows us to study any changes in the trajectory of any part of the body, which help in early diagnosis of many diseases which start with minor changes in the motion pattern of the person. This also helps in improving performance in sports by practicing to match optimal motion pattern depending on body type to achieve a better performance.

					And yes, we Know. 5 IMU's. Didnt we say a lightweight system? We did. Our IMU's have been developed by us, and they measure less than a small matchbox, and weigh 15 gm each. And putting them on is like putting on shoes.
					We understand, you tech-nuts still arent happy. We are working towards tech that will completely remove the requirement for using IMU's, and you will just have to work in a room with a camera at the corner,and that's all that will be needed to accurately track you in your virtual world, and you can do universe hopping just like that!
